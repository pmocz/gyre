Installation
************

This chapter discusses GYRE installation in detail. If you just want
to get up and running, have a look at the :ref:`quick-start` chapter.

Pre-Requisites
==============

To compile and run GYRE, you'll need the following software
components:

* A modern (2003+) Fortran compiler
* The :netlib:`BLAS <blas>` linear algebra library
* The :netlib:`LAPACK <lapack>` linear algebra library
* The :netlib:`LAPACK95 <lapack95>` Fortran 95
  interface to LAPACK
* The `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/>`__ data management library
* The `crlibm <https://hal-ens-lyon.archives-ouvertes.fr/ensl-01529804>`__ correctly rounded math library
* The :git:`crmath <rhdtownsend/crmath>` Fortran 2003 interface to crlibm
* An OpenMP-aware version of the :netlib:`ODEPACK <odepack>` differential equation library (optional)
* A `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ interpreter (3.5 or more recent)

On Linux and MacOS platforms, all of these components (save for
Python 3) are bundled together in the MESA Software Development Kit
(SDK), which can be downloaded from the `MESA SDK <mesa-sdk_>`__
homepage. Using this SDK is strongly recommended.

Building GYRE
=============

.. _install-download:

Download
--------

Download the `GYRE source code <tarball_url_>`__, and unpack it
from the command line using the :command:`tar` utility:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   $ tar xf |tarball|

Set the :envvar:`GYRE_DIR` environment variable with the path to the
newly created source directory; this can be achieved, e.g., using the
:command:`realpath` command\ [#realpath]_:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   $ export GYRE_DIR=$(realpath |dist_dir|)

.. _install-compile:

Compile
-------

Compile and install GYRE using the :command:`make` utility:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make -j -C $GYRE_DIR

(the :command:`-j` flags tells :command:`make` to use multiple cores, speeding up the build).

Test
----

To check that GYRE has compiled correctly and gives reasonable
results, you can run the calculation test suite via the command

.. code-block:: console

   $ make -C $GYRE_DIR test

The initial output from the tests should look something like this:

.. literalinclude:: installation/make-test.out
   :language: console
   :lines: 1-10

If things go awry, consult the :ref:`troubleshooting`
chapter.

Custom Builds
=============

Custom builds of GYRE can be created by setting certain environment
variables to the value ``yes``. The following variables are currently
supported:

:envvar:`FRONTENDS`
  Build main frontends such as :program:`gyre` and :program:`gyre_tides` (default ``yes``)

:envvar:`TOOLS`
  Build the support tools listed in the :ref:`support-tools` appendix (default ``yes``)

:envvar:`IFACES`
  Build additional libraries for interfacing with other codes (default ``no``)

:envvar:`FORUM`
  Build the :git:`ForUM <rhdtownsend/forum>` library internally (default ``yes``).  If not set
  to ``yes``, then you must set the :envvar:`FORUM_LIB_DIR` and :envvar:`FORUM_INC_DIR`
  environment variables to point to where the ForUM library and module files, respectively,
  are located

:envvar:`DEBUG`
  Enable debugging mode (default ``no``)

:envvar:`SHARED`
  Build shared libraries in addition to static ones (default ``yes``)

:envvar:`OMP`
  Enable OpenMP parallelization (default ``yes``)

:envvar:`FPE`
  Enable floating point exception checks (default ``yes``)

:envvar:`CRMATH`
  Enable correctly rounded math functions (default ``yes``)

:envvar:`PORTABLE`
  Enable portable math (default ``yes``)

:envvar:`IEEE`
  Use Fortran IEEE floating point features (default ``yes``)

If an environment variable is not set, then its default value is
assumed. The default values can be altered by editing the file
:file:`{$GYRE_DIR}/Makefile`.

Git Access
==========

Sometimes, you'll want to try out new features in GYRE that haven't
yet made it into a formal release. In such cases, you can check out
GYRE directly from the :git:`rhdtownsend/gyre <rhdtownsend/gyre>` git
repository on :git:`GitHub <>`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rhdtownsend/gyre.git

However, a word of caution: GYRE is under constant development, and
features in the main (``master``) branch can change without warning.

.. rubric:: footnote

.. [#realpath] The :command:`realpath` command is included in the GNU
               `CoreUtils <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>`__
               package. Mac OS users can install CoreUtils using
               `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org/>`__ or `Homebrew
               <https://brew.sh/>`__.
