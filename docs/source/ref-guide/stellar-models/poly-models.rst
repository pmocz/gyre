Polytropic Models
=================

Setting the :nml_n:`model_type` parameter of the :nml_g:`model`
namelist group to :nml_v:`'POLY'` tells the frontend to read the
equilibrium stellar model from a :ref:`POLY file <poly-file-format>`
created by the :program:`build_poly` tool. See the :ref:`comp-ptrope`
and :ref:`support-tools` appendices for further details.
